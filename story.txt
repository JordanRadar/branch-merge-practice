Once upon a time, there was a cat.
This cat bought a one-way ticket to go to outer space.
He found an interstellar taco truck.
The cat decided to order some nachos from the ITT.
From there, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the most beautiful Scottish Fold ever.
Her fur was like velvet and so was her purr.
While he was distracted looking over, his order of nachos finished and started to float away.
Oh no! Quickly, he starts floating towards his nachos.
To his suprise, the beautiful Scottish Fold catches his nachos for him.
Once the Scottish Fold brings the nachos back, they decide to share them.
And they fall in love and live happily ever after.
